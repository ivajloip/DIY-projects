# Night movement lamp

The idea for this project came after a couple of times I bumped into object in
the middle of the night when I was trying to go to the toilette.

*NOTE*: This is one of my first arduino projects, so any feedback is welcome :)

### Used materials:

The materials that I used are equivalent to the ones in that list. Note that
when I was creating the list, I was not trying to find the least expensive
parts. I just found some element that would work for me and I linked it here to
make it easier to find the appropriate elements later.

* [Arduino Nano][0]
* A breadboard
* Wires
* Battery holder and batteries
* [5V 1 canal H/L Level Triger Relais][1]
* [photoresistor][2] 
* [Passive infrared sensor (PIR)][3] 
* [220 Ohm resistor][4]
* couple of [LEDs][5]

# Wiring
